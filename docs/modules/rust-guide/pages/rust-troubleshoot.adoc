Depending on the version of Rust and the Rust tool chain that you have installed, you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior when you try to build and deploy Rust-based canisters.

In many cases, you can resolve issues by upgrading Rust or specific crates.
For example, running the `+dfx deploy+` command might fail with an error similar to the following:

....
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed
....

You can fix this error by first running the following command to add or update the WebAssembly target:

[source,bash]
----
rustup target add --toolchain stable wasm32-unknown-unknown
----

You can re-run the `+dfx deploy+` command to build and deploy the canister.
